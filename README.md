**PWA-Starter** is a project skeleton for building Single Page Apps and/or
Progressive Web Apps.

The key technology to be familiar with is React. This skeleton embraces
component based architecture, and tries to introduce very few libraries
where an API needs to be learned or memorized. You should have a strong understanding of [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) and [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

#### Example Deployments

- [https://pwa-starter.netlify.com/](https://pwa-starter.netlify.com/)
- [https://pwa-starter.herokuapp.com/](https://pwa-starter.herokuapp.com/)

Features
========

- Small bundle size [Why Preact over React?](https://gist.github.com/staydecent/9c43364c8f52e944fdb1100bcc4bae82)
- Pre-rendered pages (via [React Snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap))
- Efficient networking
- Speedy development
- *Simplicity*

Simplicity
==========

Simplicity is **always** encouraged. Generally, this means Components
that do one thing. If you component definition is getting dense, think about how you can break it up into smaller components, or move functionality into a Hook.

Documentation
=============

**PWA-Starter** is mostly just folder structure. The basic concepts you _need_ to understand are actually broken into three main components/hooks:

- [Routing](https://github.com/inputlogic/elements/tree/master/components/router)
- [Global State](https://github.com/inputlogic/elements/tree/master/components/use-mapped-state)
- [Making Requests](https://github.com/inputlogic/elements/tree/master/components/use-request)


Deploying
=========

Heroku
------

You must add the Pupeteer buildpack for prerendering to work as a build step. Order of buildpacks also matter, and should look as so:

```fish
‚ùØ heroku buildpacks
=== pwa-starter Buildpack URLs
1. https://github.com/jontewks/puppeteer-heroku-buildpack.git
2. heroku/nodejs

Commands for adding multiple build packs:
heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/jontewks/puppeteer-heroku-buildpack.git
heroku buildpacks:add --index 2 heroku/nodejs
```

Netlify
-------

Nothing! Well, setup a site at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com), then keep pushing to master.
